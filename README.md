# Extenuating Circumstances Form System
A full-stack web application developed to support the submission and management of students‚Äô extenuating
circumstances applications at the University of Sheffield. Developed using Spring Boot, React, and PostgreSQL as part of my MSc dissertation project.


## üìã Features
### Students
- View a list of submitted extenuating circumstances (EC) applications along with their overall progress and status (e.g. under review by academic staff or if more evidence is required)
- View details of a particular EC application after submission, and upload additional evidence if required
- Submit EC applications, specifying their circumstances in detail, the period they were affected, any affected modules, and providing evidence 
- Update personal information relevant to EC applications such as whether they are on a learning support plan or have any disabilities

### Clerical Staff
- View all EC applications submitted by students in the same department along with their status
- Request more evidence from students, if required
- Refer applications to academic staff for further review

### Academic Staff
- View EC applications referred by clerical staff in the same department along with their status
- Decide on individual module requests for a particular application (i.e. to approve or reject them)

### Administrator
- Approve newly registered users
- Manage modules and departments stored in the system


## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used
### Frontend
- React (JavaScript)
- TanStack (React) Query
- React Router
- Bootstrap

### Backend
- Spring Boot (Java)
- Spring MVC, Security, Data JPA, Testing
- Flyway (DB migrations)

### Database
- PostgreSQL


## üß™ Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Isolate and verify business logic in the service layer using JUnit and Mockito
- **Controller Slice Tests**: Lightweight web layer tests using Spring‚Äôs @WebMvcTest with MockMvc to simulate HTTP requests
- **Repository Slice Tests**: Database layer tests using Spring‚Äôs @DataJpaTest with an in-memory test database
- **Integration Tests**: Loading the full application context using @SpringBootTest with MockMvc to simulate HTTP requests and an in-memory test database


## üîê Security 
- Implemented token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to distinguish between student, academic staff, clerical staff, and admin responsibilities
- User approval by admins
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) mitigation by setting Content Security Policy (CSP) header, and React‚Äôs built-in output encoding
